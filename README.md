# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Classification

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning classification model to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on medical diagnostic features. The goal is to support early detection of breast cancer by leveraging data-driven techniques.

🎯 Objective

Build an accurate and reliable classification model

Analyze medical data to identify important patterns

Evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics

🗂 Dataset

The dataset contains medical features extracted from breast cancer diagnostic data.

Each record is labeled as:

0 → Benign

1 → Malignant

⚙️ Project Workflow

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling missing values
